Time complexity is O(n). During the traversal of a directory, every file is checked in the fileList to see if it's a *.c. Also, if a directory, the call is made again to populate fileList for that subdirectory. The function is called n times, recursively, until the state of no more files or directories (base case) is reached.

Spatial complexity is O(n) where n includes directories and files. For every tier in the directory, fileList lists down the files in a folder. If fileList contains a directory, then a recursive call is done again to create another fileList for that certain directory.
