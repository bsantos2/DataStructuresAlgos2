The LRU_Cache is a OrderedDict, where key and value are stored. OrderedDict provides O(1) look up, while the order to which the key and its value are kept in mind because it's an orderedDict. This makes it easier to pop the first item because of its nature. Its space complexity is O(n), as in it occupies one unit per addition of an item to the cache.
