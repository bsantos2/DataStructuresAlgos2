A linked_list is implemented to make the block chain. To make it efficient, I have been keeping track of the tail from the start, updating the tail as I append so that I don't need to start from the head of the list. This append process now makes it O(1). Printing the blockchain is O(n) because the self.head is the start and we need to go through the entire chain to print it all, with a loop. The space complexity is O(n), with n as the total number of data appended.
