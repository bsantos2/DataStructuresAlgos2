The double linked list called cache_storage is used, with a limit set to 5 for this problem. Linked list provides easy way of doing FIFO, dumping LRU easily in case of overfill. The LRU_Cache is a dict, where key and value are stored. Dict provides O(1) look up. Its contents point to the node in the cache according to that FIFO priority. This is more convenient given that the inputs of this problem are Key and Value, rather than using linked list on its own, where searching can be more cumbersome.
